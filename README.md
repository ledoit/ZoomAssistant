This is almost similar to the other [To Do List Application](https://github.com/prabhath6/to-do-list) with minor differences. Differences include most of the stuff is built using react bootstrap and with minor CSS for few components. This fancy todo list will show you progress of completion when you check/uncheck a task. Unlike the previous application this will persist completed tasks, which can be cleared if needed and one other little thing is it uses progress bar from react-bootstrap to show users progress based on completed and uncompleted tasks. 


To get started

1. Install dependencies `npm install` .
